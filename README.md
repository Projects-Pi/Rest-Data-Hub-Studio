## 2. Prerequisites
Before using **rdsctl**, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

## 3. Installation
There is no specific installation required for **rdsctl**. You can simply download the script and use it as described in the [Command Line Usage](#4-command-line-usage) section.

## 4. Command Line Usage
The **rdsctl** tool provides several commands for managing Docker Compose services within different flows of the REST DataHub Studio project.

### 4.1. up - Start Docker Compose Services
Start Docker Compose services for a specific flow or services within a flow.

```shell
rdsctl up <flow> [options]
```

Options:
- `--all`: Start all services for the specified flow.

### 4.2. build - Build Docker Compose Services
Build Docker Compose services for a specific flow or services within a flow.

```shell
rdsctl build <flow> [options]
```

Options:
- `--all`: Build all services for the specified flow.

### 4.3. down - Stop Docker Compose Services
Stop Docker Compose services for a specific flow or a specific service within a flow.

```shell
rdsctl down <flow> [service] [options]
```

Options:
- `--all`: Stop all services for the specified flow.
- `--remove-orphans`: Remove orphaned containers.

### 4.4. logs - View Docker Compose Logs
View Docker Compose logs for a specific flow or a specific service within a flow.

```shell
rdsctl logs <flow> [service] [options]
```

Options:
- `--all`: View logs for all services in the specified flow.
- `-f`: Follow log output.

## 5. Usage Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the **rdsctl** tool.

### Starting Services
Start all services for the `AuthFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl up AuthFlow --all
```

Explanation:
- `up`: This command is used to start Docker Compose services.
- `AuthFlow`: Specifies the flow for which you want to start services.
- `--all`: This option is used to start all services within the specified flow.

### Starting Specific Services
Start specific services within the `DataFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl up DataFlow GeneVariant
```

Explanation:
- `up`: Start Docker Compose services.
- `DataFlow`: The target flow.
- `GeneVariant`: Specific service within the `DataFlow` to start.

### Building Services
Build all services for the `PostgresFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl build UtilFlow PostgresFlow --all
```

Explanation:
- `build`: This command is used to build Docker Compose services.
- `UtilFlow`: Specifies the flow where the service is located.
- `PostgresFlow`: The specific service within `UtilFlow` to build.
- `--all`: This option is used to build all services within the specified flow.

### Stopping Services
Stop all services for the `AuthFlow` and remove orphaned containers:

```shell
rdsctl down AuthFlow --all --remove-orphans
```

Explanation:
- `down`: This command is used to stop Docker Compose services.
- `AuthFlow`: Specifies the flow for which you want to stop services.
- `--all`: Stop all services within the specified flow.
- `--remove-orphans`: Remove any orphaned containers associated with the services.

### Stopping a Specific Service
Stop the `AdminUserFlow` service within the `AuthFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl down AuthFlow AdminUserFlow
```

Explanation:
- `down`: Stop Docker Compose services.
- `AuthFlow`: The target flow.
- `AdminUserFlow`: The specific service within `AuthFlow` to stop.

### Viewing Logs
View logs for all services in the `DataFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl logs DataFlow --all -f
```

Explanation:
- `logs`: This command is used to view Docker Compose logs.
- `DataFlow`: The flow for which you want to view logs.
- `--all`: View logs for all services within the specified flow.
- `-f`: Follow the log output in real-time.

### Viewing Logs for a Specific Service
View logs for the `PGAdminFlow` service within the `UtilFlow`:

```shell
rdsctl logs UtilFlow PGAdminFlow
```

Explanation:
- `logs`: View Docker Compose logs.
- `UtilFlow`: The flow where the service is located.
- `PGAdminFlow`: The specific service within `UtilFlow` to view logs for.

### Purging Services
Purge (stop and remove) all services for the `GeneVariant`:

```shell
rdsctl purge DataFlow GeneVariant --all
```

Explanation:
- `purge`: This command is used to stop and remove Docker Compose services.
- `DataFlow`: The flow for which you want to purge services.
- `GeneVariant`: Specific service within `DataFlow` to purge.
- `--all`: Purge all services within the specified flow.

These examples cover a range of operations you can perform with the **rdsctl** tool, including starting, building, stopping, viewing logs, and purging services within different flows of the REST DataHub Studio project.
